When I look at Your heavens
The moon and stars You set in motion, oh God
I sing all glory and honor
What is man that You are mindful
The Son of Man that You would care for Him
We sing all glory and honor
Oh Lord, our Lord
Oh, how awesome are Your ways
How majestic is Your name in all the earth
Oh Lord, our Lord
May we see Your kingdom come
Father, may Your will be done in all the earth
